# bugs / things to do

- random state (on/off) not properly stored in cache (works half of the time on refresh)
- redundant display of the random state (toggle button + text "al√©atoire")
- white space around cards due to the cropping script not being perfect and maybe css

- filter cards by color (difficulty and/or time) and filter out purple empty cards
- remove background of the div container of the img, and remove the dynamic border radius at the same time

- transition animation between two cards can sometimes flicker and show an additionnal card in the middle of the animation
- loading animation not perfect
- loading speed still awful on page load (optimization + intelligent caching of cards needed)
