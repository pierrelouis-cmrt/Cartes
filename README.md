# bugs / things to do

- random state (on/off) not properly stored in cache (works half of the time on refresh)
- redundant display of the random state (toggle button + text "al√©atoire")
- white space around cards due to the cropping script not being perfect and maybe css

- filter out cards by color
- flicker on navigation from back: when advancing while a card is flipped, the next card briefly shows its back
